How long did the assignment take?
 - It took about 3-5h

Any extras?
 - Median filter is a little bit faster than naive implementation.
   Time to otain 3 images from lighthouse example is approx 1s
 - Some parameters of the program can be tuned by program parameters (check --help)

Collaboration acknowledgment.
 None

What was most unclear/difficult?
 In my opinion the most unclear thing was the description of obtaining channels
 other than green in edge-based demosaicing. 

What was most exciting?
 Like always in image processing - seeing results
